It sounds like your **EasyTravel** app is really coming together with a well-thought-out user flow! Here's a breakdown of the features you've mentioned and some additional considerations to make it work efficiently:

### 1. **Home Page ("Start Booking Now" Button)**
   - When users click the "Start Booking Now" button, it should redirect to the **Bus Detail Page**.

### 2. **Bus Detail Page**
   - Displays details of 10 buses, such as:
     - **Bus Number**
     - **Departure Time**
     - **Driver's Name**
     - **Motor Boy's Name**
   - Each bus should have a **"Book a Bus"** button, which will take the user to the **Book a Bus Page**.

### 3. **Book a Bus Page**
   - Here, the user inputs personal information, such as:
     - Full Name (as per ID)
     - Phone Number
     - ID Number
   - They also select the bus seat, with a visual display of available and taken seats (e.g., showing 70-seater, 55-seater, 30-seater buses).
   - After filling in details and selecting a seat, the user clicks **"Make Reservation"**, which redirects to the **Payment Page**.

### 4. **Payment Page**
   - This page should automatically generate the total price based on the number of seats selected and calculate applicable **taxes**.
   - Payment can be made through **MTN Mobile Money** or **Orange Money**.
   - Upon successful payment, the app should generate a **confirmation message** or **email/SMS** with a **reference code**.

### Backend Suggestions to Make This Work:
1. **Data Handling**:
   - **Database**: You will need a database (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store bus schedules, seats, user details, and bookings.
   - **API**: Use RESTful APIs (Node.js with Express or Django) to handle interactions between the front end and the database, managing actions like seat selection, user information submission, and payment status.

2. **Bus Seat Selection System**:
   - Each bus seat's availability should be updated in real-time to avoid double bookings. Use **WebSockets** to maintain real-time updates.
   - Implement a visual display where selected seats are marked as "taken" once booked.

3. **Payment Integration**:
   - Use **MTN MoMo API** and **Orange Money API** to facilitate seamless mobile money payments.
   - Ensure secure handling of transactions by implementing encryption standards like **HTTPS** and **payment gateways**.

4. **Notifications**:
   - Integrate SMS services (e.g., Twilio) to send booking confirmation and reminders about departure times.
   - Email confirmation can also be managed through services like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun**.
